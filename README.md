# House Price Prediction Project
Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project repository! This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features of the properties.

Project Overview
The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering to create a dataset suitable for training a machine learning model. It also includes the implementation of multiple regression models to predict the sale prices of houses. The models are evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and r-squared values. The best performing model is then used to make predictions on new data.

In this repositories, there are 2 notebooks. Both of them contains the Machine learning model code which predicts the price of the a house based on certain features. One notebook contains model build on linear regression model and another one uses Decision Tree and Random Forest.
The data set which used for the purpose of prediction is available on kaggle.
